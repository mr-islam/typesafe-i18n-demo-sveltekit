He then entered Maʿhad al-Fatḥ al-Islāmī and graduated with honors. He would attend the classes of a number of great scholars in Syria, such as Shaykh ʿAbd al-Razzāq al-Ḥalabī’s morning lessons in the Umayyad Mosque, Shaykh Khalīl al-Ṣabbāgh’s lessons in Masjid Ward al-Kabīr, and the erudite Shaykh Usāma al-Rifāʿī’s classes in the Masjid of ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Rifāʿī. He memorized parts of the Qur’an under the tutelage of Shaykh Shukrī al-Luḥafī and Shaykh Muḥammad al-Sayyid Ismāʿīl Abū Munīr.",
    "long_bio_studies_2": "Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān attended the lessons of Shaykh Muḥammad Jumuʿa for ten years and studied many books with him in various sciences in Maʿhad al-Fatḥ as well as outside of it. Among the books Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān read in Ḥanafī fiqh are: Marāqī al-Falāḥ, al-Ikhtiyār li-Taʿlīl al-Mukhtār, two-thirds of Ḥāshiyat Ibn ʿĀbidīn, some of Sharḥ al-Jaṣṣāṣ ʿalá Mukhtaṣar al-Ṭaḥāwī, Badā’iʿ al-Ṣanā’iʿ, Sharḥ al-Taṣrīḥ ʿalá al-Tawḍīḥ, and Tafsīr al-Nasafī. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān also read al-Aṣl: Mabsūṭ al-Imām Muḥammad and al-Lubāb: Sharḥ al-Kitāb by himself and reviewed more difficult passages with Shaykh Muḥammad Jumuʿa. ",
    "long_bio_studies_3": "He attended the lessons of Shaykh Muḥammad Shuqayr in Masjid al-Ḥasan and studied many works with him, such as al-Risāla al-Qushayriyya, Sunan Abī Dāwūd, al-Jāmiʿ by al-Tirmidhī, Sharḥ Ibn ʿAqīl, al-Nahw al-Wāḍiḥ, Iḥyā’ ʿUlūm al-Dīn, al-Adhkār, and Sharḥ al-Nawawī ʿalá Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān attended the lessons of the erudite scholar Shaykh Muḥammad Abū al-Hudá al-Yaʿqūbī, studying with him Sharḥ Umm al-Barāhīn by al-Sanūsī in the Umayyad Mosque and Qawā’id al-Taṣawwuf in the Masjid of Muḥyī al-Dīn b. al-ʿArabī. He attended the lessons of Shaykh Muḥammad Asʿad al-Ṣāgharjī, reading with him Sharḥ al-Mabāḥith al-Aṣliyya by ibn ʿAjība and al-Fatḥ al-Rabbāni by Shaykh ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī. He also attended the lessons of Shaykh Ḥassān al-Hindī, read with him at Maʿhad al-Fatḥ and after graduating, and benefitted greatly from him. He read Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī with Shaykh Naʿīm ʿAraqsūsī. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān attended the gatherings of ḥadīth held by Shaykh ʿUmar Nashūqātī in Masjid al-Ḥājibiyya, studied other sciences, and read several books with him, including al-Adab al-Mufrad by al-Bukhārī, al-Muwaṭṭa’ by Imam Mālik, al-Āthār by Imam Muḥammad, and the Shamā’il of Imam al-Tirmidhī.",
    "long_bio_spirituality_title": "His Spiritual Path and Taṣawwuf",
    "long_bio_spirituality_1": "Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān grew up under the nurturing wing of Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Shāghūrī as his father took him to the public and private lessons of the shaykh. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān adored Shaykh al-Shāghūrī from a young age; the latter would consistently go out of his way for Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān until God took back Shaykh al-Shāghūrī’s soul in 2004, when Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān was only eighteen years old. Consequently, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān continued the path of taṣawwuf under the guidance of Shaykh Muṣṭafá al-Turkmānī, consistently attending and recording his lessons for seven years until the shaykh’s passing. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān then completed the path under the guidance of Shaykh Shukrī al-Luḥafī; upon his instruction, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān entered spiritual seclusion (khalwa). He was also the head singer at Shaykh Shukrī’s public and private gatherings, accompanying him for several years.",
    "long_bio_spirituality_2": "Afterwards, Shaykh Muḥammad Amīn al-Fārūqī requested that Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān enter spiritual seclusion under him; thereafter, he specially authorized Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān in the path to give spiritual guidance, enter others into spiritual seclusions, and prescribe the Singular Name [i.e., a spiritual practice involving repetition of the name ‘Allāh’].",
    "long_bio_spirituality_3": "Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān then entered another spiritual seclusion under Shaykh ʿAbd al-Bāqī Miftāḥ al-Jazā’irī, who also authorized him in the path, and then with Shaykh Ḥasan al-Anṣārī al-Jazā’irī, who would authorize him as well. Among the greats he benefitted most from in the arena of experiential Sufism was Shaykh Kamāl al-Ḥusaynī al-Shamīsātī, one of the students of Shaykh Muḥammad al-Hāshimī."

    "1": "by disseminating knowledge of the formal sciences and the inner sciences of the heart in the way of as Imam al-Ghazāli and other lordly scholars  – Allah be pleased with them all.",
    "2": "by perfecting recitation of the noble Qur’an with tajwīd in its ten rescensions (in a chain of transmission and with certification) - the way the noble Companions received the Quran from the Prophet ﷺ - along with reviving the role of the Quran in the souls of Muslims",
    "3": "by reviving service to the Prophetic tradition and the noble science of hadith in terms of narration and content. Reorienting the compass of the umma to following the guidance and life of its Prophet ﷺ for its peace and salvation",
    "4": "by explaining the knowledge obligatory for every individual Muslim, man and woman, so he can worship his Lord with insight and escape the sinfulness that ignorance brings",
    "5": "by teaching the true creed held by of the righteous early generations through Sunni orthodoxy as exemplified by the Ashʿarī, Māturīdī, and Atharī methodologies and understandings of lordly scholars and experienced knowers",
    "6": "by elaborating the rulings of the Divine Law (sharīʿa) according to the schools of the four Imams – Allah be pleased upon them - so the believer can practice his religion accurately conforming to the pure Divine Law, his actions being founded on comprehension and firm knowledge and so worship Allah (Almighty) with insight and escape being a captive of ignorance and the unlawful in every moment",
    "7": "by propogating true spirituality (taṣawwuf), the spirit of the religion called the stage of excellence (ihsān) covering both halves of wayfaring and mysticism so the believer leaves all sins and adopts the character of the master of creation, Muhammad ﷺ, worshipping his Lord witnessing Him and vigilant that he himself is witnessed. This bequeaths a perfect inheritance and emulation",
    "8": "by teaching the Arabic language, the language of the Qur’an and the beloved Prophet ﷺ to understand Allah's scripture, the whole Prophetic tradition, and the words of the scholars, as is repeated, “Whoever fails to master Arabic cannot be reliable in his knowledge.”",
    "9": "by mastering the instrumental arts of semantics (maʿānī), rhetoric (bayān), literary devices (badīʿ), morphology (ṣarf), syntax (naḥw), imposition (waḍʿ), poetic meter (ʿarūḍ), and logic (manṭiq) - a student of knowledge needs these all to gain the skill of assimilating  and presenting the sciences in most exemplary manner",
