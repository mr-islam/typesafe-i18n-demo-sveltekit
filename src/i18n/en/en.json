    "long_bio_studies_1": "Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān began seeking knowledge and memorizing the noble Qur’an in Masjid al-Ashmar and Masjid Zayd b. Thābit. He then entered Maʿhad al-Fatḥ al-Islāmī and graduated with honors. He would attend the classes of a number of great scholars in Syria, such as Shaykh ʿAbd al-Razzāq al-Ḥalabī’s morning lessons in the Umayyad Mosque, Shaykh Khalīl al-Ṣabbāgh’s lessons in Masjid Ward al-Kabīr, and the erudite Shaykh Usāma al-Rifāʿī’s classes in the Masjid of ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Rifāʿī. He memorized parts of the Qur’an under the tutelage of Shaykh Shukrī al-Luḥafī and Shaykh Muḥammad al-Sayyid Ismāʿīl Abū Munīr.",
    "long_bio_studies_2": "Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān attended the lessons of Shaykh Muḥammad Jumuʿa for ten years and studied many books with him in various sciences in Maʿhad al-Fatḥ as well as outside of it. Among the books Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān read in Ḥanafī fiqh are: Marāqī al-Falāḥ, al-Ikhtiyār li-Taʿlīl al-Mukhtār, two-thirds of Ḥāshiyat Ibn ʿĀbidīn, some of Sharḥ al-Jaṣṣāṣ ʿalá Mukhtaṣar al-Ṭahāwī, Badā’iʿ al-Ṣanā’iʿ, Sharḥ al-Taṣrīḥ ʿalá al-Tawḍīḥ, and Tafsīr al-Nasafī. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān also read al-Aṣl: Mabsūṭ al-Imām Muḥammad and al-Lubāb: Sharḥ al-Kitāb by himself and reviewed more difficult passages with Shaykh Muḥammad Jumuʿa. ",
    "long_bio_studies_3": "He attended the lessons of Shaykh Muḥammad Shuqayr in Masjid al-Ḥasan and studied many works with him, such as al-Risāla al-Qushayriyya, Sunan Abī Dāwūd, al-Jāmiʿ by al-Tirmidhī, Sharḥ Ibn ʿAqīl, al-Nahw al-Wāḍiḥ, Iḥyā’ ʿUlūm al-Dīn, al-Adhkār, and Sharḥ al-Nawawī ʿalá Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān attended the lessons of the erudite scholar Shaykh Muḥammad Abū al-Hudá al-Yaʿqūbī, studying with him Sharḥ Umm al-Barāhīn by al-Sanūsī in the Umayyad Mosque and Qawā’id al-Taṣawwuf in the Masjid of Muḥyī al-Dīn b. al-ʿArabī. He attended the lessons of Shaykh Muḥammad Asʿad al-Ṣāgharjī, reading with him Sharḥ al-Mabāḥith al-Aṣliyya by ibn ʿAjība and al-Fatḥ al-Rabbāni by Shaykh ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī. He also attended the lessons of Shaykh Ḥassān al-Hindī, read with him at Maʿhad al-Fatḥ and after graduating, and benefitted greatly from him. He read Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī with Shaykh Naʿīm ʿAraqsūsī. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān attended the gatherings of ḥadīth held by Shaykh ʿUmar Nashūqātī in Masjid al-Ḥājibiyya, studied other sciences, and read several books with him, including al-Adab al-Mufrad by al-Bukhārī, al-Muwaṭṭa’ by Imam Mālik, al-Āthār by Imam Muḥammad, and the Shamā’il of Imam al-Tirmidhī.",
    "long_bio_spirituality_title": "His Spiritual Path and Taṣawwuf",
    "long_bio_spirituality_1": "Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān grew up under the nurturing wing of Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Shāghūrī as his father took him to the public and private lessons of the shaykh. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān adored Shaykh al-Shāghūrī from a young age; the latter would consistently go out of his way for Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān until God took back Shaykh al-Shāghūrī’s soul in 2004, when Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān was only eighteen years old. Consequently, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān continued the path of taṣawwuf under the guidance of Shaykh Muṣṭafá al-Turkmānī, consistently attending and recording his lessons for seven years until the shaykh’s passing. Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān then completed the path under the guidance of Shaykh Shukrī al-Luḥafī; upon his instruction, Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān entered spiritual seclusion (khalwa). He was also the head singer at Shaykh Shukrī’s public and private gatherings, accompanying him for several years.",
    "long_bio_spirituality_2": "Afterwards, Shaykh Muḥammad Amīn al-Fārūqī requested that Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān enter spiritual seclusion under him; thereafter, he specially authorized Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān in the path to give spiritual guidance, enter others into spiritual seclusions, and prescribe the Singular Name [i.e., a spiritual practice involving repetition of the name ‘Allāh’].",
    "long_bio_spirituality_3": "Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān then entered another spiritual seclusion under Shaykh ʿAbd al-Bāqī Miftāḥ al-Jazā’irī, who also authorized him in the path, and then with Shaykh Ḥasan al-Anṣārī al-Jazā’irī, who would authorize him as well. Among the greats he benefitted most from in the arena of experiential Sufism was Shaykh Kamāl al-Ḥusaynī al-Shamīsātī, one of the students of Shaykh Muḥammad al-Hāshimī."
